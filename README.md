Plays DMX events to a music clip, Python-powered Mac/Cocoa based

Reads AUP files created with Audacity. Plays the first track and sends DMX signals to a DMX controller connected via USB/pyserial.
Requires vanilla, a Python wrapper around Cocoa (https://github.com/typesupply/vanilla), pyserial and ynlib (https://github.com/yanone/ynlib).

The tool as you find it here is incomplete. It's missing an Audacity sample file and more explanations.
